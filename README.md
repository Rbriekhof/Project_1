# Project_1- The Movie Game


# ### How to Play:


The object of The Movie Game is to link one actor to another by way of a movie they starred in together.  One player selects an actor, the  movie he or she starred in, and a co-star from the aforementioned movie.  The next player starts with the actor that was selected last, and using a new film, makes another co-star connection. Movies and actors that have been used previously cannot be chosen again.  

If a player cannot complete the link in 3 attempts they are eliminated from the game and the selection process begins again with the next player.  The game continues until one player is left; he or she is the winner.
